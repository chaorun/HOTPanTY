TS has made quite a few changes to HOTPanTS version 5.1.10 in order to
do PSF matching just using point sources.

Note that the program for the most part assume that the template gets
convolved to match the image, but the program flow hasn't been totally
changed to ensure that this always happens.  Hence you should provide
the "-c t" option to force convolution on template.


Here's the brief explanations of output file extensions:

odi -- output difference image
omi -- output bad pixel mask
oni -- output noise image
ond -- output noise scaled difference image
oci -- output convolved image
ocn -- output convolved noise image
oki -- output with kernel info
