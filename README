TS has made quite a few changes to HOTPanTS version 5.1.10 in order to
do PSF matching just using point sources.

Note that the program for the most part assume that the template gets
convolved to match the image, but the program flow hasn't been totally
changed to ensure that this always happens.  Hence you should provide
the "-c t" option to force convolution on template.
